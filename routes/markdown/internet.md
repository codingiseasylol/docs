#### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

#### HTTP Methods

Commands the client sends to the server.

-   GET (read data)
-   POST (create data)

Here are some of the most common ones:

-   `200` - Everything worked as expected.
-   `400` - You have a mistake in your HTTP request.
-   `401` - You don't have access.
